I’m a full-stack software engineer with interests in **web development, artificial intelligence, and scalable systems**. My work focuses on building production-ready applications across frontend, backend, and cloud platforms, with an emphasis on clean architecture and real-world impact.

I’m currently deepening my experience with **Next.js, agentic AI systems, and full-stack application design**, and I enjoy collaborating on projects involving **web platforms, AI-driven applications, and developer-focused tools**.
